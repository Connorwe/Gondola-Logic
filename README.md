# Gondola-Logic

## Gondola Used: 
- Red line (Reference Key) 

## Logic
This code implements the logic for people choosing to use a 3.7-mile gondola to Carter Finley Stadium instead of using their cars. The code provides simple math for a set number of cars/people getting on the gondola.

## Math
- Each car emits 1480g of CO2 in 3.7 miles (according to Greenhouse Gas Emissions from a Typical Passenger Vehicle | US EPA).
- The code assumes that there is a 1:1 ratio of cars to people.
