# Gondola-Logic
** Gondola Used: Red line (Refrence Key) 
logic for people getting on a 3.7 mile gondola to Carter Finley Stadium instead of using their cars. This code is the simple math for a set amount of cars/people getting on the gondola.
** Math:
-each car emits 1480g of CO2 in 3.7 miles. (according to Greenhouse Gas Emissions from a Typical Passenger Vehicle | US EPA)  
code assumes that there is a 1:1 ratio of cars to people
